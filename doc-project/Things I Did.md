# Things I did

* Create a 1.0.0 Release
* Create a 2.0.0 Release
  * File Exchange picked it up
* Create a 1.0.1 patch release on a branch
  * File Exchange refused to pull it in because by SemVer it was less than the prior 2.0.0, and sent me a warning email. Good.
* Create a 2.0.1 Release marked as prerelease
  * Looks like File Exchange didn't pull it in; good.
* Create a 3.0.0 Release that I'm calling bogus
